# php_school_project

As a student I had one project where I needed to develope web application with php. 
Project was about Federal Organisation of SCRABBLE. I needed to create functional application that will give as all needed informations
regarding registered members, turnements, clubs, current positions, groups etc.

To be able to use this app you need also to download database for this project, also you need to have php server instaled ( I used ampps).

You can register yourself and later you will be able to login and to modify your profile

To be able to modify everything else you have to login as ADMIN. 
Admin can delete, add, modify everything (clubs, members, points, turnements etc..).

I tried to use MVC here. It was my first time to work with MVC and PHP.

To connect as admin:
email: t3@t.com
password: 123456
